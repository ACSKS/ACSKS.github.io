        <h3>Naturalist Intelligence</h3>
        I like biology and I feel that I am good at it. My interests in how things work also applies to natural creatures. In these parts of me, I have naturalist intelligence. However, I don’t like insects and am allergic to pollen. Although this doesn’t relate to the intelligence it self but it affects me on how I interact with nature.<br>
        <h3>Musical Intelligence</h3>
        I think this intelligence is one of the strongest(but not as much as logical mathematical intelligence). I like to listen to music. I hear the beat(drums) clearly and very well when listening to music. I like playing on the DAW,which is a digital audio workspace. I also like VOCALOIDS, which are singing voice synthesisers. I think these interests show my musical intelligence. In the future I would like to make music using VOCALOIDS. Therefore musical intelligence is one of the strongest intelligences for me.<br>
        <h3>Logical-mathematical Intelligence</h3>
        I think this is my strongest. I am good at mathematics. When I see things I see them through numbers. I like solving logic problems and puzzles. I like writing bullet points. I do competitive programming and competitive mathematics and they always make my life enjoyable. I feel fulfilled when I understand how something works inside and when I find out how a bug is happening in a code and fix the bug. I just enjoy knowing a new world from Maths. Mathematics makes me see the world differently. This intelligence makes me and is very important for me.<br>
        <h3>Existential Intelligence</h3>
        I think this intelligence is one of the strongest(but not as much as logical mathematical intelligence). I like to listen to music. I hear the beat(drums) clearly and very well when listening to music. I like playing on the DAW,which is a digital audio workspace. I also like VOCALOIDS, which are singing voice synthesisers. I think these interests show my musical intelligence. In the future I would like to make music using VOCALOIDS. Therefore musical intelligence is one of the strongest intelligences for me.<br>
        <h3>Interpersonal Intelligence</h3>
        <h3>Bodily-kinesthetic Intelligence</h3>
        I like running. I am very good at the beep test. I play outside with my friends during lunch break. These facts show I have a rather high Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence. Although, I feel that I am not good at some sports such as ball games. Therefore I think that it is not the strongest intelligence for me.<br>
        <h3>Linguistic Intelligence</h3>
        <h3>Intra-personal Intelligence</h3>
        I think I am strong at intrapersonal intelligence. I reflect on myself and think of myself a lot. I think I know myself very well. I am told things by my friend. I still think of myself and I try to do my best. I think this is because my interests and strengths are too professional and fewer people understand them. This makes me isolated but I have time to think of myself and understand myself. I like analysing status in real life as well. This shows my Intrapersonal intelligence.<br>
        <h3>Spatial Intelligence</h3>
